# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

The goal for my application is to check text for reoccuring words. We use a list of 20 thousands words to check text for words it has in common and how frequent they are used.

## NLP Techniques

In the project, I implemented NLP techniques including tokenization, text cleaning, and frequency analysis. The userStringToList method tokenizes the user's text by splitting it into words, while removePunctuation cleans the text by removing punctuation. The countFrequentWords method tracks word frequencies by keeping lists of words and their counts. Finally, the prompt() method displays the most frequent words and their counts. These methods work together to process/analyze the text, showing how frequent words are used.
